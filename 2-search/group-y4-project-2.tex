% Problem:
% EBay Search has gotten quite slow.  We were able to gain some time by adding
% an index to the Master DB, but we are worried about long term scaling.  We
% need to settle on a design for a SearchServce that would be used to search
% for Auctions by Keyword and/or Category (breadcrumb)

% Deliverables:
% Create a design document that explains how you would solve the search
% problem.  This document will be read by the various engineers in the company
% for evaluation of your approach,so your design needs to be understandable to
% them based on the document.

\section{Overview}
% State business problem

% Clarify what kinds of searching we are doing such as:
% - Allow searching for only active auctions 
% - Allow searching for any auction.
% - Allow a bidder to find all of their active auctions
% - Administrator looking for a specific set of auctions that have expired
% - Etc

% Need Database Schema

\section{API Specification}

\section{Service Intervals}
% Describe what internal processes you do based on APIs.
% I.E. What happens to DB when xyz is called.

\section{Changes to eBay Master Service}
% For any changes to the ebay master service, we need to provide:
% - Description of schema changes (not a full schema drawing)
% - Description of behavioral changes
%   - Describe new control  flow
%   - Describe transactional events
%   - Describe what happens on timeout from the search service.
% - Any additional API calls that are needed to be added to master service
