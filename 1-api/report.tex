\section{Overview}

\subsection{Task}
Your team is tasked with putting together a design document to show how Ebay
could change from a number of Perl scripts, each accessing the database, to a
service oriented architecture where database access and some business logic
would live in a service layer.

\subsection{Document Purpose}
This document will not assume any platform, but only discuss the interfaces
between different API endpoints that could be implemented with many different
platforms. This document will propose a series of methods, what data to pass
into them, what they might return, and what parts of the database they might
impact. The decision on which platform to use is out of scope of this document.

\subsection{General Approach}
Although the implementation details are out of scope of this document, this API
design is assuming a service based/microservice architecture. All endpoints
will accept and return serialized raw data rather than serialized objects. The
motivation for this approach is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Forces a single endpoint for like-operations, increasing the
        maintainability of the code base.
    \item Single endpoints are easier to test.
    \item Single endpoints are easier to log.
    \item Makes it easier to scale and parallelize different services based on
        load, which improves performance.
    \item Easier to manage development teams around small services with tight
        scope rather than a large and unorganized codebase.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to read this document}
This document attempts to describe the API while making as few implementation
decisions as possible. Each section will have the endpoint of the API. This is
where the user will make their request to when trying to access the API. The
parameters section describes the payload that the API expects. This will be
serialized using a format specified at implementation (but something like JSON
or XML). The response describes the different ways that the API will respond
and what parts of the system it impacts given different states.

\subsection{Terms}
\begin{description}
    \item[data/payload] This is used to describe the data that is passed to and
        from the APIs. This will be serialized in a common format that will be
        decided when planning the implementation. Possible formats may be JSON
        or XML.
\end{description}


\subsection{Services}

All of our APIs are split up into different services. Table~\ref{tab:fqdns} is
a list of all of our services along with their FQDN.
